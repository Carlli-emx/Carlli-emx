Hello, I'm Carl Li, a second year electrical engineering student who plans on specialising in artificial intelligence and it's uses in the medical industry.
I am have in-depth programming experience with Java and C, but I also have some flexibility in being able to program with Python, C++, HTML, and PHP.
Currently, I am learning about machine learning and artifiical intelligence, while also teaching myself to become more proficient with Python.
I am very experienced with Arduino, both on the software and hardware side. My main expertise with Arduino lies in wireless communication via Bluetooth and WiFi, as well as wired serial communication protocols, such as I2C and SPI.
